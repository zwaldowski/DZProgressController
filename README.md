DZProgressController
=============

`DZProgressController` is a drop-in iOS class that displays a translucent HUD with a progress indicator and an optional label. It is meant as an easy-to-use replacement for the undocumented, private class `UIProgressHUD`. 

`DZProgressController` is compatible with iOS 4 and up and released under the MIT license. It is derived from [MBProgressHUD](https://github.com/jdg/MBProgressHUD).

3. Open your project in Xcode, than drag and drop `DZProgressController.h` and `DZProgressController.m` to your Classes group (in the Groups & Files view). Make sure to select Copy Items when asked. 

If you have a git tracked project, you can add DZProgressController as a submodule to your project. 

1. `cd`` inside your git tracked project.
2. Add `DZProgressController` as a submodule using `git submodule add git://github.com/zwaldowski/DZProgressController.git DZProgressController` .
3. Open your project in Xcode, than drag and drop `DZProgressController.h` and `DZProgressController.m` to your classes group (in the Groups & Files view). Don't select Copy Items.
